3 RAG Agent – retrieves external resources and learning materials through document or web data integration for deeper insights.

Technologies Used:
Python · LangChain · OpenAI API · Gradio · CSV Data · RAG Integration

 Goal:
To make career guidance more intelligent, personalized, and accessible through AI-powered recommendations and learning paths.
